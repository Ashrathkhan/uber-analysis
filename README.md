# 📊 Uber Data Insights — Ride-hailing Optimization

## 🚀 Overview
This project analyzes Uber trip request data to uncover demand peaks, cancellation causes, trip duration consistency, and operational gaps. The insights inform strategic actions to improve trip fulfillment, rider experience, and driver efficiency.

## 📁 Structure

## 📈 Key Findings
- ⏰ Peak demand at **8–9 AM, 5–7 PM**; midday lull (10 AM–4 PM)  
- 🚫 High rate of **"No Cars Available" (39.3%)** and **Cancellations (18.7%)**  
- ⏱️ Trip durations are **normally distributed (~50 min median)**  
- 🛫 Airport pickups show **higher variability**  
- 🔗 Minimal correlation between trip duration and time of day  
- ⚠️ Missing data in **Driver ID** and **Drop Timestamp** needs resolution

## 📌 Recommendations

**Fulfillment**
- Expand driver supply in high-demand time slots  
- Use predictive fleet positioning and driver incentives  

**Cancellations**
- Segment causes and improve app UX for ETA and retries  
- Test time-sensitive pricing tweaks  

**Trip Duration**
- Build pricing models around 50-min median  
- Reduce outlier durations through routing and pooling  

**Driver Scheduling**
- Align shifts with peak hours  
- Gamify incentives during critical windows  

**Data Quality**
- Clean missing fields to improve forecasting and operational KPIs  
- Standardize data capture across key trip metrics  

## 🛠 Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Git for version control
